#### PDI (Individual Development Plans)
- **Auto-generation** from assessment profiles
- **SMART goals** with metrics, deadlines, and ownership
- **Approval workflows** for managers and HR
- **Progress tracking** with status updates and reminders
- **Action catalog** with pre-defined development activities

#### Billing & Subscriptions
- **Configurable plans** with usage limits (assessments/month, team members, modules)
- **PayPal** (primary) and **Stripe** (secondary) integration
- **Webhook handling** for renewals and dunning
- **Usage metering** with graceful blocking when limits exceeded
- **Super admin panel** for tenant and billing management

#### LGPD/Privacy Compliance
- **Consent management** with versioned terms and policies

- **Data retention** policies with automated cleanup
- **Audit trails** for all data access and modifications

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.12+ (for local development)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd psychological-assessments-saas

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
make dev

# The application will be available at:
# http://localhost:8000
```

The `make dev` command will:
1. Build Docker images
2. Start PostgreSQL, Redis, Django web server, Celery worker, and Celery beat
3. Run database migrations (including RLS setup)
4. Load seed data with sample organizations and assessments
5. Create a super admin user

### Local Development (Without Docker)

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis services locally
# Update DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL in .env accordingly

# Run migrations and seed data
make local-migrate
make local-seed

# Start development server
make local-dev
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Entities

#### Organizations
- Multi-tenant root entity with `COMPANY` or `RECRUITER` types
- Subdomain-based routing support
- Localization and branding settings

#### Users & Memberships
- Custom email-based User model with encrypted PII
- Role-based membership system (SUPER_ADMIN, ORG_ADMIN, MANAGER, HR, RECRUITER, MEMBER, VIEWER)
- Invitation workflows with secure tokens

#### Assessments
- **AssessmentDefinition**: Framework specifications (Big Five, DISC, etc.)
- **AssessmentInstance**: Individual assessment sessions with tokens
- **Session/Response**: User interaction and answer storage
- **ScoreProfile**: Calculated dimensional scores and percentiles

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tenant-scoped tables use PostgreSQL RLS with policies:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_iso_select ON public.assessments_instance
FOR SELECT USING (organization_id::text = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true));

CREATE POLICY tenant_iso_write ON public.assessments_instance
FOR ALL USING (organization_id::text = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true))
WITH CHECK (organization_id::text = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true));
```

## üß™ Assessment Instruments

The platform includes several psychological assessment tools:

### Big Five Personality (IPIP-50)
- **Public domain** 50-item questionnaire
- Measures: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- Available in PT-BR and EN
- Includes percentile norms and interpretive text

### DISC Assessment
- **Proprietary implementation** with ipsative and normative versions
- Measures: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness
